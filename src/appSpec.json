      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'background' color as the base for page backgrounds, enhanced by the 'gradientStart' to 'gradientEnd' gradient for dynamic sections. The 'primary' color is reserved for main text and key UI elements, ensuring maximum readability against lighter backgrounds. The 'secondary' color is used for accent elements such as statistic cards and highlights, paired with 'secondaryForeground' for text to maintain strong contrast. The 'graphLine' color supports graphical data elements and subtle line decorations. This palette balances calm, fresh tones with strong contrast for accessibility and visual interest, suitable for professional and corporate contexts.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primary' color on 'background' and 'secondary' on 'primaryForeground' combinations meet WCAG AA standards for text contrast. The 'secondary' color on 'primaryForeground' provides excellent readability for accent elements. Gradient transitions maintain sufficient contrast with overlaid text. Graphical elements using 'graphLine' on dark backgrounds also meet accessibility contrast requirements."
